## 🧪 How It Works

- When you click the **Load Users** button, it sends a request to the Random User API.
- It receives a JSON response with 5 users.
- Each user’s details (photo, name, email, and country) are rendered as a user card.
- The **Reload Users** button allows fetching a new set of users.
